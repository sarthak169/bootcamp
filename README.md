### Path
Is an inbuilt NodeJs feature helps to extract the correct file and it's path from all the system types. This is needed as windows returns the file, while cli based systems tends to return the path address when looking for a file. The code is mostly used when building production models and the production files have to be run and accessed.

### Cookie Parser

Is a package used to set and manage sessions data primarily. This is useful to set security to the JWT token, and can also have a value which can be used by the middlewares

### Express.json()

This is a built-in middleware function in Express. It parses incoming requests with JSON payloads and is based on body-parser.
Returns middleware that only parses JSON and only looks at requests where the Content-Type header matches the type option. This parser accepts any Unicode encoding of the body and supports automatic inflation of gzip and deflate encodings.

### cookie parser
cookie-parser is a middleware which parses cookies attached to the client request object. To use it, we will require it in our index.js file; this can be used the same way as we use other middleware. Here, we will use the following code. The browser also sends back cookies every time it queries the server.

### Path.join()
The path.join() method joins the specified path segments into one path.
You can specify as many path segments as you like.
The specified path segments must be strings, separated by comma.
